# Dispatch Monitor

I haven't been able to dockerize my project to run smoothly yet so to test the project you have to run it you have to do as following:
1. Set up Python enviroment on your PC
2. Install all the dependencies library needed to run the Yolol model in the requirements.txt
3. Execute the main.py
