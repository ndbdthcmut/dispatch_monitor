# Dispatch Monitor

I haven't been able to dockerize my project to run smoothly yet so to test the project you have to run it you have to do as following:
1. Set up Python enviroment on your PC
2. Install all the dependencies library needed to run the Yolol model in the requirements.txt
3. Put the video you want to test onto the folder contain all the models and "main.py" file
4. Rename the video to "test.mp4" (you have to ensure it have the correct name and extension in order to run)
5. Execute the main.py
